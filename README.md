## Cluster analysis and Discriminant analysis on Sina -Weibo Influencers 

Our aim is to define different roles of social media influencers quantitatively by the help of multivariate analysis techniques.

Statistical methods such as cluster analysis and discriminant analysis are used to classify the Sina-Weibo data of influencer according to their popularity and activity.
The results are as follows: 1) by  hierarchical cluster method and k-means clustering method, the roles can be divided into four categories: "superstar", "influencer", "artist" and "actors"; 2) the correct rate of Fisher's linear discriminant function was 94.5%.

The full report is Cluster analysis and Discriminant analysis on Sina -Weibo Influencers.pdf. Feel free to check it out.
